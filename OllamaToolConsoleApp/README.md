# OllamaToolConsoleApp

This project is a discovery project to learn how AI tool/function calling are working.
A C# source generator is used to annotate a C# method which can then be called by Ollama using its tool support.

Code for my blog post "[Learning AI function calling in C# with Llama 3.2 SLM and Ollama running on your machine](https://laurentkempe.com/2024/10/28/learning-ai-function-calling-in-csharp-with-llama-32-slm-and-ollama-running-on-your-machine/)".
